<p>I have a background is in photography and I've worked in the print and service industries in Portland, OR since the mid-nineties. After a decade of running 35mm film in a local theater pub, I returned to school - earning an Associates degree in Web Design & Development at Portland Community College. Since then I've worked as a teacher's assistant at a code lab, subcontracted for other design studios, and provided freelance web services for a variety of clients.</p>
